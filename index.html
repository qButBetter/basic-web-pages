    <h1>James's Favorite Activities</h1>
    <p>--I have <strong>very</strong> many hobbies that I like to do throughout the week. Many are connected through video games or talking with my friends on Discord. Here are some of the things I like to do during the week.</p>
<h2>Weekday Activities</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>Doing Math Homework, to allow time later in the week.</li>
    <li>Watching TV shows.</li>
    <li>Playing a variety of games with my friends online.</li>
    <li>Playing video games, mostly FPS</li>
    <li><strong>Sleeping.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>--I usually don't have Physics homework due to the fact that it's <em>relatively</em> easy and not work intensive. After school's done for the week, there are very many things I like to do, though it's more of a schedule than whatever I feel like doing.</p>
